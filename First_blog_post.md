# Problem and Context of the Automation
 As someone who doesn't want to have diabetes in the future, I honestly love anything sugary, taking soft drinks, carbonated drinks and wines. maintaining a healthy eating habit is very difficult but then it still needs to be curbed.

While I'm deeply interested in health and wellness, I've often encountered the challenges associated with manually calculating waist to hip ratio. in which a higher ratio (indicating more weight around the waist) is often associated with a higher risk of health problems like heart disease and type 2 diabetes."

With the challenges faced by many when it comes to manually calculating their waist-to-hip ratio which helps in our awareness of our weight around the waist, and a key indicator of our health status. The waist-to-hip ratio is important because a higher ratio, indicating more weight around the waist, is associated with an increased risk of health problems such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes.

This situation highlights the challenges that can arise when trying to balance personal preferences with health concerns. It also underscores the importance of finding practical and effective strategies to address these challenges and reduce the risk of developing serious health conditions in the future.
